# TTS_free

A simple web interface that converts user provided text to speech using `gTTS`.
The web page now uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for a cleaner UI.

The interface offers several language options including Hindi and Gujarati, as
well as multiple voice selections based on Google TTS domains.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser and enter text to generate the audio file.
